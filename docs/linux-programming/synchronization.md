The topic covers basic problems of synchronization when using threads and processes, **race condition**, the concept of **atomicity** and the **critical section**. It also covers main approaches used for overcoming synchronization problems in different scenarios introducing synchronization primitives.

## Topic Outline

1. Understanding synchronization problems and reasons behind. 
2. Definition of race condition, the concept of atomicity and the critical section.
3. Overview of synchronization primitives such as **mutex**, **semaphore**, **spin locks** and **CAS operations**.
4. Differences between synchronization primitives and drawbacks. 

## Practice

1. Writing multi-threaded program to demonstrate a race condition.
2. Solving race condition using synchronization primitives such as mutex or spin lock.
3. Programmatically comparing performance overhead of primitives in different scenarios.
