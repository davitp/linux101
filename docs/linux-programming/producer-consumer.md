The topic continues discussion about synchronization problems and defines the producer-consumer problem. It gives basic understanding of non-trivial synchronization issues and gives potential solutions using synchronization primitives such **mutex**, **semaphore** and **conditional variable**.

## Topic Outline

1. Definition of producer-consumer problem, its variations.
2. Solution strategies of multi-threaded producer-consumer problem.
3. Conditional variables, wait/notify pattern. 

## Practice

1. Write a typical multi-threaded producer consumer program to demonstrate synchronization problem.
2. Solve the problem using either semaphores or conditional variables.
