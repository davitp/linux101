The topic gives basic understanding of how file abstractions are defined in the API, the concept of file descriptors. Also main file operations such as creat, open, read, write and close are explained. 

## Topic Outline

1. The concept of the file descriptors, standard input and output.
2. Working with files using open, read, write, close functions.
3. Proper error handling while using corresponding system calls, using variable "errno".

## Practice

1. Writing simple programs to demonstrate main file operations, such as file creation, reading, etc. 
2. Demonstrate redirection of standard input and output streams using basic open/close operations.
