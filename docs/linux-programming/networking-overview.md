The topic gives a high-level background on computer networks, main concepts and protocols, the overview of TCP/IP stack. Main concepts such as **MAC addresses**, routing, **IP** and **domain name** are introduced. Transport-level (TCP, UDP) and application-level (HTTP, FTP, etc.) protocols are briefly presented with respect to their differences and application areas. 

## Topic Outline

1. The basic understanding of computer networks, overview of TCP/IP stack.
2. Understanding physical addresses, network routing and the internet protocol.
3. Transport-level protocols (TCP, UDP), their differences and application areas.
4. Application-level protocols (HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc.), application areas.

## Practice

1. Practical explanation and demonstration of various network protocols in action (IP, TCP, DNS, HTTP, etc.).
2. Using various UNIX tools to demonstrate networking in different layers (ifconfig, ping, traceroute).
