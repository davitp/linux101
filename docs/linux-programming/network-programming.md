The topic continues the discussion on the networking topic adding programmability layer on top of theoretical overview of networks. It covers main programmability concepts such as **sockets** and **application ports**, introduces the client/server communication model and the main functions of Linux API for network programming.

## Topic Outline

1. Programming computer networks, the concept of sockets and application ports.
2. The client/server model of inter-process communication on a single or multiple machines. 
3. The main socket operations, binding, listening, sending and receiving.

## Practice

1. Write a client application to connect to an existing internet host and receive a sample data.
2. Write a client and a server applications using sockets and demonstrate the communication model.
