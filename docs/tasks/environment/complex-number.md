# ENV-2: Complex numbers and sorting

### Requirements 

Write multi-file C++ program consisting of following 3 modules:
- A class that represents a complex number along with all the basic operations: plus, minus, multiply by a constant, absolute value. 
- A function that implements any sorting algorithm on an array/vector of complex numbers.
- A main function containing a demonstration of having multiple complex numbers in array and sorting them.

Modules for **complex number** class and **sorting algorithm** should be separate and each of them should have source and header files.

### Expected result

A solution containing all the described modules (source and header files), as well as, a Makefile for automated build of the solution. 

The final solution should contain a **Makefile** for the multi-stage build. The Makefile should also contain targets **all** and **clean**. It's recommended to have compiler and compiler flags to be declared as a Makefile variables. Alternatively, **cmake** could also be used instead of make.
